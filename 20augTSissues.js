Your code looks great for fetching data from the API and setting the state! There is just one small thing to adjust: you're not displaying anything inside the <li> tags in the map function.

I assume you want to display some data for each product, like its name, price, or any other property. Here’s an example of how you might update it:

import axios from "axios";
import React, { useState } from "react";

const FetchAPI: React.FC = () => {
  const [product, setProduct] = useState<any[]>([]);

  const handleClick = async (e: React.MouseEvent<HTMLButtonElement>) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    try {
      const result = await axios.get("https://dummyjson.com/products");
      const data: any[] = result.data.products;
      console.log(data);
      setProduct(data);
    } catch (error) {
      console.log("Error in fetching the API", error);
    }
  };

  return (
    <>
      <div>
        <button onClick={handleClick}>Fetch Data</button>
        <ul>
          {product.map((item, index) => (
            <li key={index}>
              <p>Name: {item.name}</p>
              <p>Price: ${item.price}</p>
            </li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      </div>
    </>
  );
};

export default FetchAPI;
Key changes:
Mapping the data: Inside the map function, I added placeholders for the product name (item.name) and price (item.price). You can adjust these based on the actual properties of the product data.

Error handling: I included the error object in the catch block for better logging.

This should render the list of products with their names and prices.

You said:
<p>Name: {item.name}</p>
              <p>Price: ${item.price}</p> not able to apply this why in this code item.id item.title not able to apply
ChatGPT said:
If you're unable to access item.name or item.price, and it's not working with item.id or item.title, there might be an issue with how the data structure is returned from the API or how you're referencing the properties.

Let’s troubleshoot a few possibilities:

1. Check the Data Structure:
It’s possible that the API response structure isn't what you're expecting. To ensure you're accessing the correct properties, log the item object to the console and verify its structure:

console.log(item);  // Log the full item object
If the data is structured differently than you expect, you may need to adjust how you access the properties. For example, the properties might be nested inside another object.

2. Inspect the Actual API Response:
In your code, you're fetching data from the https://dummyjson.com/products endpoint. I suggest inspecting the response structure of result.data.products:

const handleClick = async (e: React.MouseEvent<HTMLButtonElement>) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  try {
    const result = await axios.get("https://dummyjson.com/products");
    console.log(result.data);  // Check the full response data structure
    const data: any[] = result.data.products;
    setProduct(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.log("Error in fetching the API", error);
  }
};
Example Response Structure:
You might be expecting something like this:

{
  "products": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "title": "Product 1",
      "price": 100,
      "name": "Product Name"
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "title": "Product 2",
      "price": 200,
      "name": "Product 2"
    }
  ]
}
If the name, id, or price properties are missing or named differently (like title instead of name), you need to adjust how you're referencing them.

3. Using Correct Properties:
Assuming the data has properties like id, title, and price, you can update your map function as follows:

<ul>
  {product.map((item, index) => (
    <li key={item.id}> {/* Using item.id for the unique key */}
      <p>Title: {item.title}</p> {/* Assuming 'title' is correct */}
      <p>Price: ${item.price}</p> {/* Assuming 'price' is correct */}
    </li>
  ))}
</ul>
4. Fallback to Safe Access:
If the API sometimes returns incomplete data, consider using optional chaining (?.) to avoid accessing undefined values:

<p>Name: {item?.name}</p>
<p>Price: ${item?.price}</p>
This ensures the page doesn't crash if some properties are missing.

Conclusion:
Inspect the actual data returned by the API using console.log(result.data).

Adjust your code to reference the correct properties based on that structure.

Ensure that properties like title, name, price, etc., are correctly referenced based on the API response.

Try these steps and let me know what the actual API response looks like!
