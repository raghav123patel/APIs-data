in nextjs git directly tracking on vscode but repo is not in github
ChatGPT said:
It sounds like you're working on a Next.js project in VS Code, and Git is tracking your changes (you see version control info like modified files, commits, etc.), but you haven't pushed the repository to GitHub yet — it's only local.

Here's a breakdown of what's happening and how to proceed:

✅ What's Going On
When you create a Git repository locally (e.g., using git init), VS Code automatically picks it up.

So even if the project isn't on GitHub, Git is still tracking it locally on your machine.

This is why VS Code shows source control changes (like modified/added files).

🚀 How to Push to GitHub
If you want to push this local Git repo to GitHub, follow these steps:

Create a new repo on GitHub (go to github.com/new) — don’t initialize it with README or .gitignore if you already have those locally.

Add the remote origin in your local repo:

git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
Push your code to GitHub:

git push -u origin main
⚠️ If your branch is named master or something else, adjust the command accordingly.

🧠 Check Git Setup
To see if your local repo has a remote set up:

git remote -v
If this returns nothing, it means your repo is still local only.

Summary
✅ Git tracking locally = normal.

🧑‍💻 VS Code picks it up automatically.

🌐 GitHub is optional until you want remote storage/sharing.

🚀 Add a remote + push to GitHub when you're ready.
