yess but one question now how to identify reltionshipa i will give my all mongodbmodels on the basis of that identify relationships in these using sequelize
import mongoose, { Schema, Document } from "mongoose";
import { ROLES, Role } from "../staticfiles/roles";

export interface IUser extends Document {
  email: string;

Excellent üî• ‚Äî this is exactly what we need to identify how to design Sequelize (SQL) relationships from your MongoDB schema.

Let‚Äôs analyze everything carefully and map out the full relational structure (ER diagram logic) + how these will translate into Sequelize associations (hasOne, belongsTo, hasMany, belongsToMany).

üß© Step 1: Identify Entities (Tables)

From your models, these become SQL tables:

User

Teacher

Student

Class

Section

Subject

üß© Step 2: Identify Relations (based on ref fields)

Let‚Äôs go one by one üëá

1Ô∏è‚É£ Teacher ‚Üî Class

Teacher.classincharge ‚Üí refers to Class

Class.classincharge ‚Üí refers to Teacher

So this is one-to-one (each class has one in-charge teacher, and a teacher can be in charge of one class).

üí° In Sequelize: Teacher.hasOne(Class) and Class.belongsTo(Teacher)
But only one direction is truly needed (decide primary ownership based on logic).

‚úÖ Relation:

Teacher 1 ‚Äî 1 Class

2Ô∏è‚É£ Teacher ‚Üî Subject

Teacher.subjects ‚Üí array of Subject IDs

Subject.teacher ‚Üí single Teacher ID

So this is one-to-many (one teacher teaches many subjects, but one subject belongs to one teacher).

‚úÖ Relation:

Teacher 1 ‚Äî * Subject


Sequelize:

Teacher.hasMany(Subject, { foreignKey: "teacherId" });
Subject.belongsTo(Teacher, { foreignKey: "teacherId" });

3Ô∏è‚É£ Class ‚Üî Section

Class.sections ‚Üí array of Section IDs

So this is one-to-many ‚Äî one class can have many sections.

‚úÖ Relation:

Class 1 ‚Äî * Section


Sequelize:

Class.hasMany(Section, { foreignKey: "classId" });
Section.belongsTo(Class, { foreignKey: "classId" });

4Ô∏è‚É£ Class ‚Üî Subject

Class.subjects ‚Üí array of Subject IDs

A class has many subjects. Each subject can be taught in many classes (in real schools ‚Äî same subject reused).
So this is many-to-many (since Subject may belong to multiple classes).

‚úÖ Relation:

Class * ‚Äî * Subject


Sequelize:

Class.belongsToMany(Subject, { through: "ClassSubjects" });
Subject.belongsToMany(Class, { through: "ClassSubjects" });

5Ô∏è‚É£ Class ‚Üî Student

Student.class ‚Üí single Class ID
So this is one-to-many ‚Äî one class has many students.

‚úÖ Relation:

Class 1 ‚Äî * Student


Sequelize:

Class.hasMany(Student, { foreignKey: "classId" });
Student.belongsTo(Class, { foreignKey: "classId" });

6Ô∏è‚É£ User ‚Üî Teacher / Student

From your current code, User seems to handle authentication only, while Teacher and Student have role fields.
There are 2 ways to design it:

Option A (Simple ‚Äî like now)

Each Teacher/Student has their own auth (email, password) in their respective tables.
‚Üí No relation to User.

Option B (Corporate-Level)

Use User as the parent account for login, and link Teacher/Student to it.

‚úÖ Relation (Option B):

User 1 ‚Äî 1 Teacher
User 1 ‚Äî 1 Student


Sequelize:

User.hasOne(Teacher, { foreignKey: "userId" });
Teacher.belongsTo(User, { foreignKey: "userId" });

User.hasOne(Student, { foreignKey: "userId" });
Student.belongsTo(User, { foreignKey: "userId" });

üß© Step 3: Full Relationship Summary
Entity	Relationship	Type	Sequelize Association
Teacher ‚Üî Class	One-to-One	Teacher.hasOne(Class) / Class.belongsTo(Teacher)	
Teacher ‚Üî Subject	One-to-Many	Teacher.hasMany(Subject) / Subject.belongsTo(Teacher)	
Class ‚Üî Section	One-to-Many	Class.hasMany(Section) / Section.belongsTo(Class)	
Class ‚Üî Subject	Many-to-Many	Class.belongsToMany(Subject, { through: "ClassSubjects" })	
Class ‚Üî Student	One-to-Many	Class.hasMany(Student) / Student.belongsTo(Class)	
User ‚Üî Teacher	One-to-One	User.hasOne(Teacher) / Teacher.belongsTo(User)	
User ‚Üî Student	One-to-One	User.hasOne(Student) / Student.belongsTo(User)	
üß© Step 4: Diagram Summary (Text Format)
User
 ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 1 Teacher
 ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 1 Student

Teacher
 ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ teaches many Subjects
 ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ in charge of 1 Class

Class
 ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ has 1 Teacher (class incharge)
 ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ has many Students
 ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ has many Sections
 ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ has many Subjects (through ClassSubjects)

Subject
 ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ belongs to 1 Teacher

‚úÖ Step 5: Next Action

Now that we‚Äôve clearly mapped your relationships, we can:

Create Sequelize models for each (Teacher, Student, Class, etc.)

Add all associations exactly as listed above

Then convert your existing APIs (like deleteStudent, createTeacher, etc.) to Sequelize equivalents.

Would you like me to generate all Sequelize model definitions + relationships setup based on this relationship map next?
(It‚Äôll be a complete models/index.ts + all table models ready for your migration from MongoDB ‚Üí PostgreSQL.)
