parallel data fetching in nextjs full explanation
ChatGPT said:
Got it 👍 — let’s break down parallel data fetching in Next.js step by step with examples, so you understand both the “why” and the “how.”

🔹 What is Data Fetching in Next.js?
In Next.js (especially from v13+ with the App Router), data fetching happens on the server by default. You can fetch data from APIs, databases, or microservices inside Server Components, Route Handlers, or getServerSideProps (in the Pages Router).

Normally, fetching data looks like this:

async function Page() {
  const user = await getUser();
  const posts = await getPosts();

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{user.name}</h1>
      <ul>
        {posts.map(p => <li key={p.id}>{p.title}</li>)}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}
👉 The problem:

getUser() runs first.

Only after it finishes does getPosts() run.

That’s sequential fetching, which is slow if both requests could happen at the same time.

🔹 Parallel Data Fetching
To optimize performance, you want both requests to start at the same time. You do this using Promise.all or by creating the promises before awaiting them.

✅ Example with Promise.all
async function Page() {
  const [user, posts] = await Promise.all([
    getUser(),  // runs in parallel
    getPosts()  // runs in parallel
  ]);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{user.name}</h1>
      <ul>
        {posts.map(p => <li key={p.id}>{p.title}</li>)}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}
➡️ Now, both getUser() and getPosts() start fetching at the same time.
This cuts down latency to the longest single request, instead of adding them up.

🔹 Example with Pre-Created Promises
Another trick is to start the fetches before awaiting:

async function Page() {
  const userPromise = getUser();   // starts fetching immediately
  const postsPromise = getPosts(); // starts fetching immediately

  const user = await userPromise;
  const posts = await postsPromise;

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{user.name}</h1>
      <ul>
        {posts.map(p => <li key={p.id}>{p.title}</li>)}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}
This does the same as Promise.all, but sometimes gives you more control (e.g., if you want to handle one result earlier).

🔹 Where Parallel Fetching Helps in Next.js
Server Components (App Router)
All fetch() calls in Server Components are automatically deduped and cached, but if you have multiple independent async calls, you should use Promise.all.

Route Handlers (app/api/.../route.ts)
When combining multiple backend services, fetch them in parallel to reduce API latency.

getServerSideProps or getStaticProps (Pages Router)
Same logic applies—parallel fetching reduces page load time.

🔹 Streaming and Suspense (Next.js 13+)
Parallel fetching becomes even more powerful with React Suspense + streaming.
Instead of waiting for all data to load, you can stream parts of the UI as soon as some data is ready.

Example:

// app/page.tsx
import User from './User';
import Posts from './Posts';

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Suspense fallback={<p>Loading user...</p>}>
        <User />
      </Suspense>
      <Suspense fallback={<p>Loading posts...</p>}>
        <Posts />
      </Suspense>
    </div>
  );
}
And inside User.tsx and Posts.tsx, you can fetch data independently.
Next.js will load them in parallel and stream UI chunks as each finishes.

🔹 Quick Performance Comparison
Let’s say:

getUser() takes 200ms

getPosts() takes 500ms

Sequential fetching: 200ms + 500ms = 700ms

Parallel fetching: max(200ms, 500ms) = 500ms

That’s a 200ms savings — multiplied across many requests, it’s huge.

✅ Summary

Use Promise.all (or pre-created promises) to fetch data in parallel.

This avoids unnecessary sequential latency.

Works in Server Components, API routes, and getServerSideProps.

Combine with React Suspense + streaming for even better UX.

Do you want me to also show you how parallel fetching looks in both Pages Router (getServerSideProps) and App Router (Server Components) side by side, so you can compare?

import axios from "axios";

    const response = await axios.get("https://dummyjson.com/posts");
    const results = response.data;
    console.log(results);
}

const getComments = async() => {
    const res = await axios.get("https://dummyjson.com/comments");

        getPosts(),
        getComments(),
      ]);

      return (
        <div>
          <h1>Welcome, {posts.title}</h1>
          <h2>Your Posts:</h2>
        </div>
      );
} why posts.titlr not working
ChatGPT said:
I see the problem 👀

In your code, getPosts() and getComments() don’t return anything — they just console.log the results.
So when you do:

const [posts, commentData] = await Promise.all([
  getPosts(),
  getComments(),
]);
➡️ posts and commentData are both undefined.
That’s why posts.title doesn’t work (you’re basically doing undefined.title).

Fix:
You need to return the data from your functions:

import axios from "axios";

const getPosts = async () => {
  const response = await axios.get("https://dummyjson.com/posts");
  return response.data; // ✅ return the data instead of just console.log
};

const getComments = async () => {
  const res = await axios.get("https://dummyjson.com/comments");
  return res.data; // ✅ return the data
};

export default async function Page() {
  const [posts, commentData] = await Promise.all([
    getPosts(),
    getComments(),
  ]);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome, {posts.posts[0].title}</h1> {/* ✅ pick a post title */}
      <h2>Your Posts:</h2>
    </div>
  );
}
Why posts.posts[0].title?
If you check the API response from https://dummyjson.com/posts, the shape is:

{
  "posts": [
    { "id": 1, "title": "His mother had always taught him" },
    { "id": 2, "title": "He was an expert..." }
  ],
  "total": 150,
  "skip": 0,
  "limit": 30
}
So the title isn’t at posts.title, it’s inside posts.posts[0].title.

👉 Do you want me to also show you how to loop through all the posts and display them in the JSX?
