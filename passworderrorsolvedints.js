if apply validation like password should not incude in api call what is the method?
ChatGPT said:

Yes! If you want certain fields (like password) to never be allowed in the API request, even if the frontend sends them, you can use Joi‚Äôs .forbidden() method.

Here‚Äôs how it works:

import Joi from "joi";

const createUserSchema = Joi.object({
  firstName: Joi.string().required(),
  lastName: Joi.string().required(),
  email: Joi.string().email().required(),
  role: Joi.string().valid("user", "admin").optional(),
  password: Joi.forbidden(), // <- password cannot be sent by the client
}).strict();


Explanation:

Joi.forbidden() ‚Üí Rejects the request if the key exists in the payload.

.strict() ‚Üí Ensures no unknown keys sneak in unless explicitly allowed.

Example behavior:

// Payload 1 (valid)
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "email": "john@gmail.com"
}

// Payload 2 (invalid, password sent)
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "email": "john@gmail.com",
  "password": "123456"  // ‚ùå Will fail validation
}


This is considered best practice for sensitive fields that should only be handled by the backend, like passwords during update or creation via admin APIs.

If you want, I can also show how to combine .forbidden() with .unknown(false) to make your API strictly reject any extra fields.

Do you want me to show that?

You said:
still password is coming in api call
ChatGPT said:

Ah! If you‚Äôre still seeing password in your API call despite using Joi.forbidden(), it usually happens for one of these reasons in TypeScript + Express setup:

1Ô∏è‚É£ .validate() is not enforcing strict mode

Even if you added .strict(), make sure you are passing allowUnknown: false (or { stripUnknown: true } if you want to remove unknown keys).

Example:

const { error, value } = createUserSchema.validate(req.body, {
  abortEarly: false,
  allowUnknown: false, // ‚ùå unknown keys will trigger error
});
if (error) {
  return res.status(400).json({
    success: false,
    message: error.details.map(d => d.message).join(", "),
  });
}


allowUnknown: false ensures any extra fields like password are rejected.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Payload is still reaching the DB

Even if Joi rejects password, if you‚Äôre not using value (the sanitized version) and instead use req.body for DB operations, the field might still be saved.

‚úÖ Correct way:

const userData = value; // validated & sanitized payload
const user = await User.create(userData);


Do not do:

const user = await User.create(req.body); // ‚ùå bypasses validation

3Ô∏è‚É£ Double-check .forbidden()

Make sure your schema actually has it:

password: Joi.forbidden()


This will cause validation error if password is present.

Combined with allowUnknown: false, any other unexpected fields will also fail.

If you want, I can write a full example createUser controller in TypeScript that rejects password or any extra fields safely using Joi.

Do you want me to do that?

You said:
i am telling that i am sending the password in payload it is stored in db through hashing but i am asking that it should go in api call acc to the backend best practice
ChatGPT said:

Got it üëç thanks for clarifying.
You‚Äôre asking not about frontend sending password, but whether it‚Äôs good backend practice that your API accepts password in the request body and stores it (hashed).

‚úÖ The answer is:
Yes ‚Äî it should go in the API call, because without the client sending a password, you can‚Äôt register/login a user. That‚Äôs how authentication works.

But the best practices around it are:

üîí Backend Best Practices for Password Handling

Accept password in payload

On register ‚Üí accept password in req.body

On login ‚Üí accept password in req.body
üëâ This is correct, expected, and required.

Validate it (with Joi or Zod)

Enforce rules like: minimum length, special characters, not too weak.

password: Joi.string().min(8).max(30).required()


Never store plain text

Always hash it with bcrypt (or argon2).

const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(password, 10);


Never return password in API responses

Even hashed passwords should not be returned.

Use .select("-password") in Mongoose or remove it before sending response.

Transport securely

Use HTTPS, so password is encrypted in transit.

Frontend should never store raw password

Only send it once during login/register.

After login, use tokens (JWT, session) instead of re-sending password.

‚ùå Wrong approach (what you‚Äôre worried about)

If your API accepts role or other sensitive fields (like isAdmin) from payload, that‚Äôs bad practice ‚Üí those should be set by backend only.

But password is an exception ‚Äî it must come from frontend (user chooses it).

üëâ So you are right to allow password in API call, it‚Äôs the correct backend practice.
What you should not allow is password leaking in responses or being stored raw.

Do you want me to show you a secure register + login API in TypeScript (with Joi validation + bcrypt + no password leaks in responses)?

ChatGPT said:

Great, thanks for sharing your login API code üôå

From what I see, your main issue is: you‚Äôre returning the full user object in the response, which still includes the password field (because you explicitly selected it with .select("+password")).

üîë How to remove password before sending response

There are a few good ways to handle this in TypeScript + Mongoose:

‚úÖ Option 1: Manually remove password before sending
const { password: _, ...userWithoutPassword } = user.toObject();

return res.status(200).json({ 
  success: true, 
  token, 
  user: userWithoutPassword,
  message: "Principal logged in successfully" 
});


Here:

user.toObject() converts the Mongoose doc into a plain object.

{ password: _, ...rest } destructures and drops the password.

You then send the safe object.

‚úÖ Option 2: Use .select("-password") when fetching user

Since you already fetch password for comparison, you can fetch twice:

const user = await User.findOne({ email }).select("+password");
if (!user) { ... }

// verify password
const valid = await bcrypt.compare(password, user.password);
if (!valid) { ... }

// fetch again without password
const safeUser = await User.findById(user._id).select("-password");

return res.status(200).json({
  success: true,
  token,
  user: safeUser,
  message: "Principal logged in successfully"
});

‚úÖ Option 3: Use Mongoose toJSON transform (Best Practice)

Define a schema transform once so password is always stripped whenever you JSON.stringify or return user:

userSchema.set("toJSON", {
  transform: function (doc, ret) {
    delete ret.password;
    return ret;
  }
});


Then you don‚Äôt need to worry in every controller ‚Äî res.json(user) will never include password.

üëâ Best practice: Option 3 (schema-level cleanup), but in your current case, Option 1 is the quickest fix.

‚ö° Would you like me to rewrite your login controller with Option 1 implemented so password is never leaked?

You said:
option 3 where to write this 
ChatGPT said:

Good question üëç

Option 3 (the schema toJSON transform) is written inside your Mongoose model file ‚Äî the same file where you defined your userSchema.

In your project, that‚Äôs in models/auth.model.ts.

Here‚Äôs how you update it:

import mongoose, { Schema, Document } from "mongoose";
import { ROLES, Role } from "../staticfiles/roles";

export interface IUser extends Document {
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  email: string;
  password: string;
  role: Role;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}

const userSchema: Schema<IUser> = new Schema(
  {
    firstName: { type: String, required: true },
    lastName: { type: String, required: true },
    email: { type: String, required: true, unique: true },
    password: { type: String, required: true, select: false }, // not selected by default
    role: { type: String, enum: Object.values(ROLES), default: ROLES.user },
  },
  { timestamps: true }
);

// üöÄ Remove password whenever we convert doc to JSON
userSchema.set("toJSON", {
  transform: function (doc, ret) {
    delete ret.password; // remove password
    return ret;
  },
});

export default mongoose.model<IUser>("User", userSchema);

üîé What this does

Every time you send a User object in a response (res.json(user)), the password is automatically stripped.

You don‚Äôt need to manually remove it in every controller.

Even if you used .select("+password") for login verification, the returned response will not contain password.

‚ö° Would you like me to rewrite your login controller with this schema-level fix, so you see how clean it becomes?

You said:
  delete ret.password; // remove password The operand of a 'delete' operator must be optional.ts(2790)
(property) IUser.password: string showing this error in these line while writing in the schema
ChatGPT said:

Ahh yes ‚úÖ ‚Äî you‚Äôre hitting a TypeScript typing issue here.

The error happens because in your IUser interface you declared:

password: string;


That means TS thinks password will always exist, so delete ret.password is invalid.

But in practice, after Mongoose transforms a doc to JSON, ret.password can be removed.

üîß Fix

There are 2 clean options:

Option 1: Mark password as optional in the interface

Since we never actually want to expose it outside, we can declare it as optional:

export interface IUser extends Document {
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  email: string;
  password?: string;   // <- make it optional
  role: Role;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}


Now delete ret.password; compiles fine.

Option 2: Use a type cast in the transform

If you prefer to keep password required in the schema interface:

userSchema.set("toJSON", {
  transform: function (doc, ret: any) {
    delete ret.password;
    return ret;
  },
});


Casting ret to any tells TS ‚Äúdon‚Äôt complain about deletes here‚Äù.

üëâ For backend best practice, I recommend Option 1 ‚Äî declare password as optional in the interface.
Because when you actually expose IUser objects (after JSON transformation), they will not have a password.

Do you want me to also show you how to update your login controller so the response is 100% type-safe with this fix?

You said:
password?: string; my question is how this optionall in scema we use required true clearify these
ChatGPT said:

Good catch üëç Let‚Äôs carefully clear this up:

1. Mongoose Schema vs TypeScript Interface

They are different layers:

Mongoose Schema ‚Üí runtime rules for MongoDB.

password: { type: String, required: true, select: false }


üëâ This means: in the database every user must have a password stored.

TypeScript Interface ‚Üí compile-time type checking in your Node.js code.

password?: string;


üëâ This means: in your TypeScript objects, password might be missing (for example, after .toJSON() removes it before sending a response).

2. Why password?: string in TS is OK even if required: true in schema?

In the DB layer (Mongoose schema), password must exist ‚Üí required.

In the response layer (after .toJSON transform), password may not exist because you remove it with:

delete ret.password;


So TypeScript must allow "password may be missing" in objects you work with ‚Üí password?: string.

That‚Äôs why we mark it as optional in the interface.
It‚Äôs not about changing the DB rule ‚Äî it‚Äôs about reflecting what happens in your API output.

3. Best practice

‚úÖ Keep required: true in the Mongoose schema ‚Üí ensures DB integrity.
‚úÖ Mark password?: string in the TypeScript interface ‚Üí ensures type safety when serializing to JSON.

üëâ Think of it like this:

Inside DB: password always required.

Outside DB (API): password optional because we hide it.

ChatGPT said:

Got it ‚úÖ ‚Äî this error is coming from TypeScript‚Äôs type system, not from Mongoose or bcrypt. Let‚Äôs break it down carefully:

üîπ Why you‚Äôre getting the error
const valid = await bcrypt.compare(password, user.password);


Error:

Argument of type 'string | undefined' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string'.


password comes from Joi validation ‚Üí TypeScript sees it as string | undefined because Joi schemas don‚Äôt guarantee compile-time typing.

user.password is optional (password?: string;) in your IUser interface (remember we made it optional because we remove it in toJSON).

So TS thinks both can be undefined, but bcrypt requires strict string.

üîπ Fix Option 1 (Non-null assertion)

If you‚Äôre 100% sure both values exist here:

const valid = await bcrypt.compare(password!, user.password!);


üëâ The ! tells TypeScript ‚Äútrust me, this is not undefined‚Äù.

üîπ Fix Option 2 (Type narrowing with guard)

More safe and explicit:

if (!password || !user.password) {
  return res.status(400).json({
    success: false,
    message: "Password missing",
  });
}

const valid = await bcrypt.compare(password, user.password);


üëâ This way TypeScript knows both are strings.

üîπ Fix Option 3 (Improve Type Definition)

In your IUser model:

password: string; // keep required (not optional)


And only make it optional in the response transform when sending back to frontend.
That way, in DB queries like findOne().select("+password"), TS will guarantee that user.password is a string.

‚úÖ Best Practice: Use Option 2. Explicit null-checks keep your code safe and clear for corporate-level backend projects.

üëâ Do you want me to show you the final corrected login controller with this Option 2 applied so it‚Äôs fully TS-safe?
