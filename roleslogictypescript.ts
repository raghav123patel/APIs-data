export const ROLES = {
  user: "user",
  admin: "admin",
  superAdmin: "superAdmin",
} as const;

export type Role = typeof ROLES[keyof typeof ROLES]; i have worked till now with js now explain the code properly so i can get ts easily and what changes ts vs js  
as const;

export type Role = typeof ROLES[keyof typeof ROLES]; this code is added so explain acc to the instruction i have given

Absolutely! Let’s break this TypeScript-specific code down carefully so it makes sense, especially coming from JavaScript.

1️⃣ The code
export const ROLES = {
  user: "user",
  admin: "admin",
  superAdmin: "superAdmin",
} as const;

export type Role = typeof ROLES[keyof typeof ROLES];

2️⃣ Step-by-step explanation
Step 1: export const ROLES = { ... } as const;

In JS, you might write:

const ROLES = {
  user: "user",
  admin: "admin",
  superAdmin: "superAdmin",
};


This is fine, but in TS:

as const


as const does two things:

Makes the object readonly (you cannot accidentally reassign ROLES.user = "something" later).

Makes the values literal types, not just string.

Without as const:

const ROLES = { user: "user" };
// Type of ROLES.user is string


With as const:

const ROLES = { user: "user" } as const;
// Type of ROLES.user is "user" (string literal)


✅ This is important because now TypeScript can infer exact allowed values, which is very useful for type safety.

Step 2: export type Role = typeof ROLES[keyof typeof ROLES];

Let’s unpack it:

typeof ROLES → This gets the TypeScript type of the object { user: "user"; admin: "admin"; superAdmin: "superAdmin" }.

keyof typeof ROLES → This gets a union of the keys: "user" | "admin" | "superAdmin".

typeof ROLES[keyof typeof ROLES] → This gets a union of the values corresponding to those keys: "user" | "admin" | "superAdmin".

So now:

type Role = "user" | "admin" | "superAdmin";


This allows you to type variables or function parameters strictly to these allowed roles:

function assignRole(role: Role) {
  console.log(`Assigned role: ${role}`);
}

assignRole("admin"); // ✅ OK
assignRole("manager"); // ❌ Error: "manager" is not a Role

3️⃣ Key differences: TS vs JS here
Feature	JS	TS
Object values type	Just string	Literal type "user" (with as const)
Type safety for functions	None	Can strictly allow only valid role strings
Compile-time error checking	No errors at compile time	Errors if invalid role is used
Readonly behavior	Can be reassigned	as const makes object and properties readonly
4️⃣ TL;DR

as const → makes object immutable and values literal types.

type Role = typeof ROLES[keyof typeof ROLES] → creates a strict union type of all role values.

Benefit: you get autocomplete, type safety, and compile-time errors if you try invalid roles.

If you want, I can rewrite your entire roles logic and role-based checks in TS using this Role type so your new backend is fully type-safe.

Do you want me to do that next?
