Good question 👍

You’re right — in Mongoose, you often use:

User.findById(id)


In Sequelize, there’s no findById method. Instead, you use:

1. findByPk (Primary Key)
const user = await User.findByPk(id);


👉 Equivalent of findById in Mongoose.
👉 Works only when you’re searching by primary key (usually id).

2. findOne (More flexible)
const user = await User.findOne({ where: { id } });


👉 Same result as findByPk, but you can use custom conditions too.

3. findAll (Multiple records)
const users = await User.findAll({ where: { role: "admin" } });


👉 Returns array of users, not just one.

✅ So if you just want the Mongoose-style findById,
use findByPk(id) in Sequelize.

Do you want me to make a cheat sheet mapping Mongoose methods → Sequelize equivalents for quick reference?

so what happen when uuid is there in table so how primary key concept wotks when we apply findbypk method

Ahh 🔑 great question — you’ve touched a real-world Sequelize + UUID use case.

Let’s break it down 👇

1. Primary Key concept

In any relational DB (Postgres, MySQL, etc.), the primary key is just a column that uniquely identifies each row.

It doesn’t have to be an auto-increment integer (id).

It can be a UUID, a string, or even a composite key.

2. Sequelize with UUID as Primary Key

When you define your model:

const { DataTypes } = require("sequelize");
const sequelize = require("../config/db");

const User = sequelize.define("User", {
  id: {
    type: DataTypes.UUID,
    defaultValue: DataTypes.UUIDV4, // auto-generate UUID
    primaryKey: true,               // <- primary key is UUID
  },
  name: {
    type: DataTypes.STRING,
    allowNull: false,
  },
});


Now the primary key = UUID.
Sequelize knows id is the PK because of primaryKey: true.

3. Using findByPk with UUID
const user = await User.findByPk("f47ac10b-58cc-4372-a567-0e02b2c3d479");


👉 This works exactly the same as with integer PK.
👉 Sequelize just queries:

SELECT * FROM "Users" WHERE "id" = 'f47ac10b-58cc-4372-a567-0e02b2c3d479';

4. If the PK is not called id

Example:

const Order = sequelize.define("Order", {
  orderNumber: {
    type: DataTypes.UUID,
    defaultValue: DataTypes.UUIDV4,
    primaryKey: true,
  },
  total: DataTypes.FLOAT,
});


Then:

const order = await Order.findByPk("uuid-here");


👉 Sequelize automatically looks at whatever column you marked as primaryKey: true.

✅ Conclusion:

findByPk always works with the column you marked as the primary key.

Whether it’s INTEGER, UUID, or something else — Sequelize maps it properly.

For UUID-based PKs, you just pass the UUID string to findByPk.

Would you like me to show you a real-world project structure where some tables use UUID and others use INTEGER as PK, and how findByPk works consistently in both?
